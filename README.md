# URL Shortener CGI-BIN Module in Python for Apache

MODULES USED :
  - LAMP (linux, apache, mod-cgi)
  - Python (2.7 Python CGI bin module)
  - ReCAPTCHA by Google
  
This Server Program was Intended for Use with a LAMP (Linux Apache) typed Server but the exlcusiveness is really the Apache Server in which we take advanatge of the CGI module Support and change the settings the the VirtualHosts file  -000 but it simply runs as an apache python cgi module in which when you call its specified route it will execute. This application is a custom built open source code demonstration of the logic needed to simply take a large link and store it under a shorter crypted text reference for redirection.
